algorithm
setup()
{
	init kinect.
	create the structuring elements B1 and B2 for hit or miss
}

update()
{

grab a depth frame from kinect
do_thresh(near,far) on depth frame
dilate the depth frame.
do_hit_or_miss(B1,B2) 
dilate the depth frame.
run find countour on depth frame.
find the centroids
get the depth in meters of the centroids.
}


draw()
{
draw the raw depth frame
draw the dilated depth frame
draw the depth after hit or miss
draw the depth after dilation 
draw the contours on the dilated depth frame.
}
