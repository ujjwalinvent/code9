I will plot a graph between farthreshold and depth 
using this graph I will determine the relationship between  depth and farthreshold
then farthreshold can be varied accordingly.
but intially I need to we need to increase the farthreshold until we detect glass 
for the first time.

Modules :
Libfreenect: used to access kinect hardware
openframeorks: An architecture for doing the processing of kinect frames
cv_util.hpp : opencv utilities.
morph.hpp : morphologoical processing library.
depth_lib.hpp : for processing the depth information 
functions for thresholding 
functions for processing the depth 
functions for storing the depth info 
functions for reading the depth info



algorithm
setup()
{
	init kinect.
	create the structuring elements B1 and B2 for hit or miss
	setup connection to arduino.
}

update()
{

grab a depth frame from kinect
do_thresh(near,far) on depth frame
dilate the depth frame.
do_hit_or_miss(B1,B2) 
//dilate the depth frame.
run find countour on depth frame.
find the centroids
get the depth in meters of the centroids.

if(MOVE_ROBOT_MODULE_ON)
{
if(glass is detected && glass_depth>threshold)
	//code to adjust the bot at the center.
	if(glass is at center)
		send forward command.
	if (glass is at left)
		send left command.
	if (glass is at right)
		send right command.

	set report string to glass detected
	adjust farThreshold according to glass_depth [need caliberation]
if(glass is not detected)
	//run rotate360 function.
	send left command.
	send stop bot command.
	set report string to glass not detected
if(glass is detected && glass_depth<threshold)
	stop bot command
	run Grab module wait for the grab module to finish.
	set report string to glass detected && depth<threshold;
}

}


draw()
{
draw the raw depth frame
draw the dilated depth frame
draw the depth after hit or miss
draw the contours on the output depth frame.
}

keypress(key)
{
	if(key = M) then toggle MOVE_ROBOT_MODULE_ON;
}



state machine:
state 0: robot is stopped
state 1: robot is started
state 2: glass detected
state 3: glass not detected
state 4: near glass
state 5: glass grabbed
state 6: glass released
state 7: done
