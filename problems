The servo motor is heated up when we synchronize them.
looks like they have to apply some torque.
the bot is not moving straight need to change the speed of the motors 
so that it moves straight.
need to record videos for different objects and then do the 
testing on them.
the left and right are very fast need to slow them down.
idea:
I will not use the raw depth information to adjust the farthreshold
rather i will use the gray information to adjust the farthreshold

We can store the raw depth data by using some fast compression algorithm.
then that can be converted to point cloud as and when needed.

the open and close gripper also has some problems need to see them also.
they open and close are not properly synchronized.

I can use wooden board and drill holes into it and fix the circuit on the board.
